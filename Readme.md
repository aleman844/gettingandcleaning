The features selected for this database come from the one accelerometer and 
gyroscope 3-axial this values was captured to 50hz


The names of the variables is structured in a hierarquical shape, in six levels so:

1. time or freq: this indicate that the value it is in times values in seconds or frequency in hz
2. Body or Grav: some values are split into Body that mean, that it is the meassure of the subject or gravity
		that means that the value it is obtained for the gravity force.
3. acc or gyr: it is the source of the messuare, acc it is accelerometer or gyr for gyroscope
4. jrk or mag:  jrk by jerk, it is a ratio of angular accelation and mag it the norma eculidian magnitud obtained by each axis 
5. mean or stdr: It idicated that this variable is a statistic value
6. x, y or z: show the axis that it is consider.
